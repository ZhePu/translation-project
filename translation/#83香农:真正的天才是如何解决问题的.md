# Claude Shannon: How a Genius Solves Problems  
克劳德·香农（信息论之父）：天才的解决问题之道

It took Claude Shannon about a decade to fully formulate his seminal theory of information.  
克劳德·香农花了差不多10年，制定了一套完整的、具有开创性意义的信息理论。

He first flirted with the idea of establishing a common foundation for the many information technologies of his day (like the telephone, the radio, and the television) in graduate school.  
一开始在研究生院时，他只是想给当时的众多信息技术（如电话，收音机，电视机）建立一套通用的技术基础。

It wasn’t until 1948, however, that he published A Mathematical Tgit heory of Communication.  
直到1948年，他发表了一篇名为《通信的数学理论》的论文。

This wasn’t his only big contribution, though. As a student at MIT, at the humble age of 21, he published a thesis that many consider possibly the most important master’s thesis of the century.  
他的重大贡献可不止这篇论文。当他还在MIT攻读硕士时，年仅21岁的他发表了一篇论文，这也被大家认为是20世纪最重要的硕士论文。

To the average person, this may not mean much. He’s not exactly a household name. But if it wasn’t for Shannon’s work, what we think of as the modern computer may not exist. His influence is enormous not just in computer science, but also in physics and engineering.  
对于普通人来说，这无足轻重。香农并不是一个家喻户晓的名字。但如果没有他的贡献，我们所说的现代计算机可能不会存在。他巨大的的影响力不仅在计算机科学领域，而且涉及物理学和工程学。

The word genius is thrown around casually, but there are very few people who actually deserve the moniker like Claude Shannon. He thought differently, and he thought playfully.  
天才一词被到处滥用，但如克劳德·香农这样真正配得上这个称号的人却屈指可数。他思考的方式异于常人，而且充满趣味。

One of the subtle causes behind what manifested as such genius, however, was the way he attacked problems. He didn’t just formulate a question and then look for answers, but he was methodological in developing a process to help him see beyond what was in sight.  
讲到成就这样一位天才背后的原因，不得不提的就是他解决问题的方式。他不只是提出问题然后解决问题，而是他通过自己的方法，开发了一套思考过程来指导他洞察问题的本质。

His problems were different from many of the problems we are likely to deal with, but the template and its reasoning can be generalized to some degree, and when it is, it may just help us think sharper, too.  
虽然我们不太可能遇到他面临的问题，但这种解决问题的方法及其背后的推理还是有很多可以借鉴的地方，当我们了解了之后，或许可以帮我们更敏锐地思考。

All problems have a shape and a form. To solve them, we have to first understand them.  
一切问题都有其表现形式。我们必须先去理解问题，再着手解决问题。

## Build a Core Before Filling the Details
## 在抠细节前先找到问题核心

The importance of getting to an answer isn’t lost on any of us, but many of us do neglect how important it is to ask a question in such a way that an answer is actually available to us.  
找到问题答案固然很重要，但找到一种提问方式，以便更易于找到问题答案的重要性却被大多数人忽视了。

We are quick to jump around from one detail to another, hoping that they eventually connect, rather than focusing our energy on developing an intuition for what it is we are working with.  
我们通常把目光聚焦在不同的细节上，想找到它们之间的联系，却没有集中精力去培养一种寻找问题本质的直觉。

This is where Shannon did the opposite. In fact, as his biographers note in A Mind at Play, he did this to the point that some contemporary mathematicians thought that he wasn’t as rigorous as he could be in the steps he was taking to build a coherent picture. They, naturally, wanted the details.  
香农恰恰反其道而行之。在他的自传《A Mind at Play》中，他坦言一些同时代的数学家觉得他思考不够严谨，步骤不够连贯。他们想要的是细节。

Shannon’s reasoning, however, was that it isn’t until you eliminate the inessential from the problem you are working on that you can see the core that will guide you to an answer.  
但是香农的推理方式是，只有你去掉问题中无关的细节，才能看到问题的本质，才能找到问题的答案。

In fact, often, when you get to such a core, you may not even recognize the problem anymore, which illustrates how important it is to get the bigger picture right before you go chasing after the details. Otherwise, you start by pointing yourself in the wrong direction.  
通常情况下，当你看到问题的本质时，你可能觉得这根本不是之前思考的那个问题。所以，拿到一个问题时，在你纠结细节之前，以更宏观的角度来思考是很重要的，否则，你一开始就可能走歪了。

Details are important and useful. Many details are actually disproportionately important and useful relative to their representation. But there are equally as many details that are useless.  
细节很重要，也很有用。很多细节的重要程度、能起多大作用跟其表现方式有关。但同样的，很多细节也没什么用。

If you don’t find the core of a problem, you start off with all of the wrong details, which is then going to encourage you to add many more of the wrong kinds of details until you’re stuck.  
如果一开始没有找到问题的关键所在，而是带着错误的细节信息就出发了，那样只会收集越来越多的错误信息，直到走进死胡同里。

Starting by pruning away at what is unimportant is how you discipline yourself to see behind the fog created by the inessential. That’s when you’ll find the foundation you are looking for.  
从剔除无关细节开始，这样你才不会深陷迷雾当中，然后才能找到问题的本质。

Finding the true form of the problem is almost as important as the answer that comes after.  
找到问题的真正形式，这几乎和问题答案一样重要。

## Harness Restructuring and Contrast
## 善用重构和对比

In a speech given at Bell Labs in 1952 to his contemporaries, Shannon dived into how he primes his mind to think creatively when addressing things that are keeping him occupied.  
1952年，香农在贝尔实验室发表了一次演讲。演讲中，他深入分析了他如何创造性地思考他面临的问题。

Beyond simplifying and looking for the core, he suggests something else — something that may not seem to make a difference on the surface but is crucial for thinking differently.  
除了简化问题和寻找问题本质，他还提到了其他的方法，这些方法在表面上似乎没什么作用，但对于创造性思考却至关重要。

Frequently, when we have spent a lot of time thinking about a problem, we create a tunnel vision that rigidly directs us along a singular path. Logical thinking starts at one point, makes reasoned connections, and if done well, it always leads to the same place every time.  
当我们在一个问题上纠结了很长时间之后，通常会形成一种管窥思维，使得思路一直在一条链路上徘徊。逻辑思考总是从一个点出发，运用推理，建立连接，如果一切顺利，每次都会把我们带到同一个终点。

Creative thinking is a little different. It, too, makes connections, but these connections are less logical and more serendipitous, allowing for what we think of as new thinking patterns.  
创造性思维则有些不同。它也建立连接，但比起逻辑思维，它是一种更发散、更具偶然性的思考模式。

One of Shannon’s go-to tricks was to restructure and contrast the problem in as many different ways as possible. This could mean exaggerating it, minimizing it, changing the words of how it is stated, reframing the angle from where it is looked at, and inverting it.  
香农的其中一个诀窍就是，他会把一个问题通过各种各样的方式来重构并进行对比。这可能会对问题进行夸大、或简略、或改变措辞、或转换不同的角度、或反转。

The point of this exercise is simply to get a more holistic look at what is actually going on.  
这样做是为了获得一种大局观，让他能更全面地看问题。

It’s easy for our brain to get stuck in mental loops, and the best way to break these mental loops is to change the reference point. We are not changing our intuitive understanding of the problem or the core we have identified, just how it is expressed.  
在思考问题时，我们很容易陷入自我的思维怪圈之中，要打破这种思维怪圈，最好的方式是改变参考点。不必颠覆自己对问题的直觉认知或是已认定的问题本质，而仅仅是改变表达方式。

We could, for example, ask: What is the best way to solve this? But we could also ask: What is the worst way to solve this? Each contains knowledge, and we should dissect both.  
例如，我们可以问：这个问题最好的解决方式是什么？并且也可以问：最糟糕的解决方式呢？两者都包含信息，所以我们都需要剖析。

Just as a problem has forms, it also has many shapes. Different shapes hold different truths.  
就如同一个问题有多种形式，也有多种不同的外在呈现的模样。 不同的模样蕴含着不同的真相。

## Multiply the Essence of Every Input
## 增加输入信息蕴含的本质

While it’s important to focus on the quality of ideas, it’s perhaps just as important to think about the quantity. Not just concerning total numbers but also how you get to those numbers.  
想法的质量固然重要，但其数量的作用也不容小觑。但并不是仅关注于想法的总数，而是关注你得到这些想法的过程。

To solve a problem, you have to have a good idea. In turn, to have a good idea, it’s often the case that you have to first go through many bad ones. Even so, however, throwing anything and everything at the wall isn’t the way to do that. There is more to it than that.  
为了解决问题，你必须有一个好想法。但反过来，要有一个好想法，首先你需要筛选掉很多平庸的念头。然而，即便如此，并不意味着要把脑子里所有的想法都拿出来过一遍吗，肯定有比这更好的方法。

During the Second World War, Shannon met Alan Turing, another computer science pioneer. While Turing was in the US, they had tea almost every day. Over the years, they continued to keep in touch, and both men respected the other’s thinking and enjoyed his company.  
在二战期间，香农遇到了同为计算机科学先驱的艾伦·图灵。图灵在美国的那段时间，他们几乎每天一起喝茶。多年来，他们仍保持着联系，两人都尊重彼此的想法并享受对方的陪伴。

When discussing what he thinks constitutes genius, Shannon used an analogy shared with him by Turing, from which he extrapolated a subtle observation. In his own words:
“There are some people if you shoot one idea into the brain, you will get a half an idea out. There are other people who are beyond this point at which they produce two ideas for each idea sent in.”
He humbly denied that he was in the latter category, instead putting people like Newton in there. But if we look beyond that, we can see what is at play. It’s not just about quantity.  
当被问到天才具有什么特质时，香农用了一个图灵告诉他的类比，也是图灵经过敏锐地观察后得出的。以下是他的原话：  
“有些人，你给他/她一个点子，他/她只会回你半个，但有些人能回你两个”  
香农谦逊地否认了自己属于后者，而牛顿这样的人才是。但他的话也说明了，真正对解决问题发挥作用的，决不仅仅是点子的数量。

Every input has a particular essence at its core that communicates a truth that lies behind the surface. This truth is the foundation for many different solutions to many different problems.  
每个输入的信息都有其核心的精髓，能帮我们揭开掩盖真相的面纱。这个真相是不同问题的多种不同解决方案的基础。

What Shannon is getting at, I suspect, is that generating good ideas is about getting good at multiplying the essence of every input. Bad ideas may be produced if you get the essence wrong, but the better you identify it, the more effectively you’ll be able to uncover insights.  

我认为，香农想说的是，要产生好点子，就要善于发掘每个输入信息所蕴含的本质。如果你弄错了其本质，就可能产生出错误的想法，但只要你能够尽可能的触及问题的本质，就能越快地得出真知灼见。

Doubling the output of your ideas is the first step, but capturing the essence is the difference.  
让你的想法产生双倍的成效只是第一步，真正带来本质区别的是要抓住本质。

## All You Need to Know
## 总结

Much of life — whether it’s in your work, or in your relationships, or as it relates to your well-being — comes down to identifying and attacking a problem so that you can move past it.  

人的一生大部分时刻，无论在你的工作中、人际交往中、还是关系到你的幸福感的时候，归结起来就是发现问题，解决问题，好让你能继续前进。

Claude Shannon may have been a singular genius with a unique mind, but the process he used isn’t out of reach for any of us. His strength was in this process and its application.  
克劳德·香农或许是一个具有独特思维的天才，但他思考问题的过程并非常人所不可及。他的长处在于善于运用该过程来解决问题。

Good problem-solving is a product of both critical and creative thinking. The best way to combine them is to have some process in place that allows each to shine through.  
优秀的解决问题的能力关乎批判性思维和创造性思维。而综合两者的最好的方式便是在思考的过程中，让两者各放异彩。

Thinking patterns shape our minds. The goal is to have the right thinking patterns doing so.  
思维模式塑造我们的思想。正确的思维模式应该成为我们追求的目标。
